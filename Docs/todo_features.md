- More geom primitives
  - teapot?
    - bezier patch
    - http://www.holmes3d.net/graphics/teapot/

  - smooth addition ("Smooth Union, Subtraction and Intersection - bound, bound, bound")
  - rounded corners https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/ ("Rounding - exact")

  - combined rotation and translation as a matrix
- rewrite modules to have a <directory>.rs at toplevel

  - BRDF (there are a few databases of materials out there, would be cool to support them)

- simplex(?) noise https://docs.rs/noise/latest/noise/
- fog
- GLTF loading
  - handle triangle vertex normals
- add colors from Crayola crayon boxes
  - wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors
- material texture support (e.g. for posters, decals)
- "renderable object" that collects geometry, shader
- "scene" container for lights, renderable objects
  - loadable from JSON, above
- cmdline arg for JSON filename
- other building blocks, including 2x4x1 blocks with semi-circle cuts
  for arches, bridges
- soft shadows
- revisit sky
  - just a shader?
  - implement star map
  - maybe a city skyline
  - trees
  - https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/procedural-generation-virtual-worlds/simulating-sky
- support RGBA output
  - useful when rendering without a sky
  - useful when rendering sprites for 2d games
- fancy selector shaders
  - select based on 3 x y z hat vectors dotted with normal
  - select based on 6 x y z hat vectors dotted with normal
  - select based on 1 vector (e.g. grass on top, dirt elsewhere)
  - select based on SDF; positive is mat1, negative is mat2
    - allows me to shade the inside of dice pips based on using similar "masks" to the carving out geom
- geometry selector
  - e.g. LOD based on distance
- repeat modifiers
  - xyz
  - xy
- randomized offset based on position
  - for e.g. forest
- marching cubes?
- supersampling
  - grid based
  - randomized
- fractal landscape https://iquilezles.org/articles/fbmsdf/
  - https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ws3XWl
- interpolate normals over triangle mesh

- GPU support?

- motion blur
  - time-extended transformations
- benchmark tests
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.16.0/book/benchmark-tests.html
  - https://github.com/elalfer/rust-performance-timing
- cone tracing for hierarchical performance improvement
- cone/beam bounds turned into world bounds at the point of collision,
  for more informed shading.
  - e.g. a checkerboard shader fading to an average color to reduce
    high frequency aliasing
- tagging of "layers" to enable rendering car counter sprites
  - render the body first, with no ground plane, with alpha skybox
  - render the ground underneath to get (soft?) shadows, but with the
    car geometry flagged as only visible to shadows
  - save both as RGBA images
